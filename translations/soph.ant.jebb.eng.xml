<stage>Scene: Before the Royal Palace at Thebes.</stage>

 


<pb n="126"/>


<pb n="127"/>


<sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker><p>

Ismene, sister, mine own dear sister, knowest thou
what ill there is, of all bequeathed by Oedipus, that
Zeus fulfils not for us twain while we live? Nothing
painful is there, nothing fraught with ruin, no shame, no
dishonour, that I have not seen in thy woes and mine.

And now what new edict is this of which they tell,
that our Captain hath just published to all Thebes?
Knowest thou aught? Hast thou heard? Or is it hidden
from thee that our friends are threatened with the doom
<milestone unit="line" n="10"/>
of our foes?

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Ismene</speaker><p>


No word of friends, Antigone, gladsome or painful,
hath come to me, since we two sisters were bereft of
brothers twain, killed in one day by a twofold blow;
and since in this last night the Argive host hath fled,
I know no more, whether my fortune be brighter, or
more grievous.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker><p>
I knew it well, and therefore sought to bring
thee beyond the gates of the court, that thou mightest
hear alone.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Ismene</speaker><p>
<milestone unit="line" n="20"/>
What is it? ’Tis plain that thou art brooding
on some dark tidings.


<pb n="128"/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker><p>
What, hath not Creon destined our brothers,
the one to honoured burial, the other to unburied shame?
Eteocles, they say, with due observance of right and
custom, he hath laid in the earth, for his honour among
the dead below. But the hapless corpse of Polyneices—
as rumour saith, it hath been published to the town that
none shall entomb him or mourn, but leave unwept, unsepulchred,

<milestone unit="line" n="30"/>
a welcome store for the birds, as they espy
him, to feast on at will.

Such, ’tis said, is the edict that the good Creon
hath set forth for thee and for me,—yes, for me,—and
is coming hither to proclaim it clearly to those who
know it not; nor counts the matter light, but, whoso
disobeys in aught, his doom is death by stoning before
all the folk. Thou knowest it now; and thou wilt soon
show whether thou art nobly bred, or the base daughter
of.a noble line.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Ismene</speaker><p>
Poor sister,—and if things stand thus, what

<milestone unit="line" n="40"/>
could I help to do or undo?

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker><p>
Consider if thou wilt share the toil and the
deed.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Ismene</speaker><p>
In what venture? What can be thy meaning?

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker><p>
Wilt thou aid this hand to lift the dead?

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Ismene</speaker><p>
Thou wouldst bury him,—when ’tis forbidden
to Thebes?

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker><p>
I will do my part,—and thine, if thou wilt
not,—to a brother. False to him will I never be found.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Ismene</speaker><p>
Ah, over-bold! when Creon hath forbidden ?

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker><p>
Nay, he hath no right to keep me from mine own.

<milestone unit="line" n="50"/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Ismene</speaker><p>
Ah me! think, sister, how our father perished,
amid hate and scorn, when sins bared by his own search


<pb n="129"/>


had moved him to strike both eyes with self-blinding
hand; then the mother wife, two names in one, with
twisted noose did despite unto her life; and last, our
two brothers in one day,—each shedding, hapless one,
a kinsman’s blood,—wrought out with mutual hands
their common doom. And now we in turn—we two
left all alone—think how we shall perish, more miserably
<milestone unit="line" n="60"/>
than all the rest, if, in defiance of the law, we brave
a king’s decree or his powers. Nay, we must remember,
first, that we were born women, as who should not strive
with men; next, that we are ruled of the stronger, so
that we must obey in these things, and in things yet
sorer. I, therefore, asking the Spirits Infernal to pardon,
seeing that force is put on me herein, will hearken to
our rulers; for ’tis witless to be over busy.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker><p>
I will not urge thee,—no, nor, if thou yet
<milestone unit="line" n="70"/>
shouldst have the mind, wouldst thou be welcome as
a worker with me. Nay, be what thou wilt; but I will
bury him: well for me to die in doing that. I shall rest,
a loved one with him whom I have loved, sinless in my
crime; for I owe a longer allegiance to the dead than
to the living: in that world I shall abide for ever. But
"if thou wilt, be guilty of dishonouring laws which the
gods have stablished in honour.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Ismene</speaker><p>
I do them no dishonour; but to defy the State,
I have no strength for that.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker><p>
<milestone unit="line" n="80"/>
Such be thy plea:—I, then, will go to heap the
earth above the brother whom I love.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Ismene</speaker><p>
Alas, unhappy one! How I fear for thee!

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker><p>
Fear not for me: guide thine own fate
aright.




<pb n="130"/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Ismene</speaker><p>
At least, then, disclose this plan to none, but
hide it closely,—and so, too, will I.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker><p>
Oh, denounce it! Thou wilt be far more
hateful for thy silence, if thou proclaim not these things
to all.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Ismene</speaker><p>
Thou hast a hot heart for chilling deeds.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker><p>
I know that I please where I am most bound
to please.

<milestone unit="line" n="90"/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Ismene</speaker><p>
Aye, if thou canst; but thou wouldst what thou
canst not.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker><p>
Why, then, when my strength fails, I shall
have done.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Ismene</speaker><p>
A hopeless quest should not be made at all.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker><p>
If thus thou speakest, thou wilt have hatred.
from me, and will justly be subject to the lasting hatred
of the dead. But leave me, and the folly that is mine
alone, to suffer this dread thing; for I shall not suffer
aught so dreadful as an ignoble death.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Ismene</speaker><p>
Go, then, if thou must; and of this be sure,—
that, though thine errand is foolish, to thy dear ones
thou art truly dear. 

<stage>Exit ANTIGONE on the spectators’ left. ISMENE retires into the palace by one of the two side-doors.</stage>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker><p>
<milestone unit="line" n="100"/>
<milestone unit="str" n="1"/>
Beam of the sun, fairest light that ever dawned on
Thebè of the seven gates, thou hast shone forth at last,
eye of golden day, arisen above Dircé’s streams! The
warrior of the white shield, who came from Argos in
his panoply, hath been stirred by thee to headlong
flight, in swifter career ;


<pb n="131"/>


<milestone unit="syst" n="1"/>
who set forth against our land by reason of the 
<milestone unit="line" n="110"/>
vexed claims of Polyneices; and, like shrill-screaming
eagle, he flew over into our land, in snow-white pinion
sheathed, with an arméd throng, and with plumage of
helms. </p>

<p><milestone unit="ant" n="1"/>
He paused above our dwellings; he ravened around 
<milestone unit="line" n="120"/>
our sevenfold portals with spears athirst for blood; but
he went hence, or ever his jaws were glutted with our
gore, or the Fire-god’s pine-fed flame had seized our
crown of towers. So fierce was the noise of battle
raised behind him, a thing too hard for him to conquer,
as he wrestled with his dragon foe.</p>

<p><milestone unit="syst" n="2"/>
For Zeus utterly abhors the boasts of a proud 
tongue; and when he beheld them coming on in a
<milestone unit="line" n="130"/>
great stream, in the haughty pride of clanging gold,
he smote with brandished fire one who was now hasting

to shout victory at his goal upon our ramparts.</p>

<p><milestone unit="str" n="2"/>
Swung down, he fell on the earth with a crash, 
torch in hand, he who so lately, in the frenzy of the
mad onset, was raging against us with the blasts of his
tempestuous hate. But those threats fared not as he
hoped ; and to other foes the mighty War-god dispensed
their several dooms, dealing havoc around, a mighty
<milestone unit="line" n="140"/>
helper at our need.</p>

<p>
<milestone unit="syst" n="3"/>
For seven captains at seven gates, matched against 
seven, left the tribute of their panoplies to Zeus who
tutns the battle; save those two of cruel fate, who,
born of one sire and one mother, set against each other


<pb n="132"/>


their twain conquering spears, and are sharers in a
common death.

<milestone unit="ant" n="2"/>
But since Victory of glorious name hath come to

us, with joy responsive to the joy of Thebè whose

<milestone unit="line" n="150"/>
chariots are many, let us enjoy forgetfulness after the

late wars, and visit all the temples of the gods with

night-long dance and song; and may Bacchus be our
leader, whose dancing shakes the land of Thebè.

<milestone unit="syst" n="4"/>
But lo, the king of the land comes yonder, Creon,

son of Menoeceus, our new ruler by the new fortunes

that the gods have given; what counsel is he pondering,

<milestone unit="line" n="160"/>
that he hath proposed this special conference of elders,
summoned by his general mandate?

<stage>Enter CREON, from the central doors of the palace, in the garb of king ; with two attendants.</stage>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
Sirs, the vessel of our State, after being tossed
on wild waves, hath once more been safely steadied by
the gods: and ye, out of all the folk, have been called
apart by my summons, because I knew, first of all, how
true and constant was your reverence for the royal
power of Larus; how, again, when Oedipus was ruler
of our land, and when he had perished, your steadfast

<milestone unit="line" n="170"/>
loyalty still upheld their children. Since, then, his
sons have fallen in one day by a twofold doom,—each
smitten by the other, each stained with a brother's
blood,—I now possess the throne and all its powers, by
nearness of kinship to the dead.</p>


<pb n="133"/>


<p>No man can be fully known, in soul and spirit and
mind, until he hath been seen versed in rule and lawgiving.
For if any, being supreme guide of the State,
<milestone unit="line" n="180"/>
cleaves not to the best counsels, but, through some fear,
keeps his lips locked, I hold, and have ever held, him
most base and if any makes a friend of more account
than his fatherland, that man hath no place in my
regard, For I—be Zeus my witness, who sees all things
always—would not be silent if I saw ruin, instead of
safety, coming to the citizens; nor would I ever decm
the country’s foe a friend to myself; remembering this,
that our country is the ship that bears us safe, and that
<milestone unit="line" n="190"/>
only while she prospers in our voyage can we make true
friends.</p>

<p>Such are the rules by which I guard this city’s
greatness, And in accord with them is the edict which
I have now published to the folk touching the sons of
Oedipus ;—that Eteocles, who hath fallen fighting for
our city, in all renown of arms, shall be entombed, and
crowned with every rite that follows the noblest dead
to their rest. But for his brother, Polyneices,—who
<milestone unit="line" n="200"/>
came back from exile, and sought to consume utterly
with fire the city of his fathers and the shrines of his
fathers’ gods,—sought to taste of kindred blood, and to
lead the remnant into slavery ;—touching this man, it
hath been proclaimed to our people that none shall
grace him with sepulture or lament, but leave him unburied,
a corpse for birds and dogs to eat, a ghastly
sight of shame.

Such the spirit of my dealing; and never, by deed
of mine, shall the wicked stand in honour before the


<pb n="134"/>


just ; but whoso hath good will to Thebes, he shall be
<milestone unit="line" n="210"/>
honoured of me, in his life and in his death.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker><p>
Such is thy pleasure, Creon, son of Menoeceus,
touching this city’s foe, and its friend; and thou hast
power, I ween, to take what order thou wilt, both for
the dead, and for all us who live.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
See, then, that ye be guardians of the mandate.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker><p>
Lay
the burden of this task on some younger
man.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
Nay, watchers of the corpse have been found.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker><p>
What, then, is this further charge that: thou
wouldst give?

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
That ye side not with the breakers of these
commands.

<milestone unit="line" n="220"/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker><p>
No man is so foolish that he is enamoured of
death.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
In sooth, that is the meed; yet lucre hath oft
ruined men through their hopes.

<stage>Enter GUARD.</stage>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Guard</speaker><p>
 My liege, I will not say that I come breathless
from speed, or that I have plied a nimble foot ; for often
did my thoughts make me pause, and wheel round in my
path, to return. My mind was holding large discourse
with me; ‘Fool, why goest thou to thy certain doom ?’
‘Wretch, tarrying again? And if Creon hears this from

<milestone unit="line" n="230"/>
another, must not thou smart for it?’ So debating,
I went on my way with lagging steps, and thus. a short
road was made long. At last, however, it carried the
day that I should come hither—to thee; and, though


<pb n="135"/>


my tale be nought, yet will I tell it; for_I_come with C
a good grip on one hope,—that I can suffer nothing but ate
what is my fate. 

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
And what is it that disquiets thee thus?

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Guard</speaker><p>
 I wish to tell thee first about myself—I did
not do the deed—I did not see the doer—it were not
<milestone unit="line" n="240"/>
right that I should come to any harm.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
Thou hast a shrewd eye for thy mark; well
dost thou fence thyself round against the blame:—
clearly thou hast some strange thing to tell.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Guard</speaker><p>
 Aye, truly; dread news makes one pause long.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
Then tell it, wilt thou, and so get thee gone?

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Guard</speaker><p>
 Well, this is it—The corpse—some one hath
just given it burial, and gone away,—after sprinkling
thirsty dust on the flesh, with such other rites as piety
enjoins, .

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
What sayest thou? What living man hath
dared this deed?

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Guard</speaker><p>
 I know not; no stroke of pickaxe was seen
<milestone unit="line" n="250"/>
there, no earth thrown up by mattock ; the ground was
hard and dry, unbroken, without track of wheels; the
doer was one who had left no trace. And when the
first day-watchman showed it to us, sore wonder fell on
all. The dead man was veiled from us; not shut within
a tomb, but lightly strewn with dust, as by the hand of
one who shunned a curse. And no sign met the eye
as though any beast of prey or any dog had come nigh
to him, or torn him.

Then evil words flew fast and loud among us, guard
<milestone unit="line" n="260"/>
accusing guard ; and it would e’en have come to blows
at last, nor was there any to hinder. Every man was

tye od?


<pb n="136"/>


the culprit, and no one was convicted, but all disclaimed
knowledge of the deed. And we were ready to take
red-hot iron in our hands ;—to walk through fire ;—to
make oath by the gods that we had not done the deed,
—that we were not privy to the planning or the doing,
At last, when all our searching was fruitless, one
spake, who made us all bend our faces on the earth in
<milestone unit="line" n="270"/>
fear; for we saw not how we could gainsay him, or
escape mischance if we obeyed. His counsel was that
this deed must be reported to thee, and not hidden.
And this seemed best ; and the lot doomed my hapless
self to win this prize. So here I stand,—as unwelcome
as unwilling, well I wot; for no man delights in the
bearer of bad news.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker><p>
O king, my thoughts have long been whispering,
can this deed, perchance, be e’en the work of gods?
<milestone unit="line" n="280"/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
Cease, ere thy words fill me utterly with wrath,
lest thou be found at once an old man and foolish. For
thou sayest what is not to be borne, in saying that the
gods have care for this corpse. Was it for high reward
of trusty service that they sought-to hide his nakedness,
who came to burn their pillared\shrines and sacred
treasures, to burn their land, and scatter its laws to the
winds? Or dost thou behold the gods honouring the
wicked? It cannot be. No! From the first there were
<milestone unit="line" n="290"/>
ago certain in the town that muttered against me, chafing
at this edict, wagging their heads in secret; and kept
not their necks duly under the yoke, like men contented
with my sway.</p>

<p>'Tis by them, well I know, that these have been
beguiled and bribed to do this deed. Nothing so evil as


<pb n="137"/>


money ever grew to be current among men. This lays
cities low, this drives men from their homes, this trains
and warps honest souls till they set themselves to works

<milestone unit="line" n="300"/>
of shame; this still teaches folk to practise villanies,
and to know every godless deed.

But all the men who wrought this thing for hire
have made it sure that, soon or late, they shall pay the
price. Now, as Zeus still hath my reverence, know this—
I tell it thee on my oath :—If ye find not the very author
of this burial, and produce him before mine eyes, death
alone shall not be enough for you, till first, hung up
alive, ye have revealed this outrage,—that henceforth
<milestone unit="line" n="310"/>
ye may thieve with better knowledge whence lucre
should be won, and learn that it is not well to love gain
from every source. For thou wilt find that ill-gotten
pelf brings more men to ruin than to weal.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Guard</speaker><p>
 May I speak? Or shall I just turn and go?

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
Knowest thou not that even now thy voice
offends?

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Guard</speaker><p>
 Is thy smart in the ears, or in the soul?

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
And why wouldst thou define the seat of my

pain?

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Guard</speaker><p>
 The doer vexcs thy mind, but I, thine ears,
<milestone unit="line" n="320"/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
Ah, thou art a born babbler, ’tis well scen.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Guard</speaker><p>
 May be, but never the doer of this deed.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
Yea,and more,—the seller of thy life for silver.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Guard</speaker><p>
 Alas! ’Tis sad, truly, that he who judges should
misjudge.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
Let thy fancy play with ‘judgment’.asit will; 
but, if ye show me not the doers of these things, ye
shall avow that dastardly gains work sorrows. [Z£xtz.


<pb n="138"/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Guard</speaker><p>
 Well, may he be found! so ’twere best. But,
be he caught or be he not—fortune must settle that—
truly thou wilt not see me here again. Saved, even

<milestone unit="line" n="330"/>
now, beyond hope and thought, I owe the gods great
thanks,

Wonders are many, and none is more wonderful than

man; the power that crosses the white sea, driven by

the stormy south-wind, making a path under surges that

the soil with the offspring of horses, as the ploughs
go to and fro from year to year.

<milestone unit="ant" n="1"/>
And the light-hearted race of birds, and the tribes

of savage beasts, and the sea-brood of the deep, he

snares in the meshes of his woven toils, he leads captive,

man excellent in wit. And he masters by his arts the

<milestone unit="line" n="350"/>
he tames the horse of shaggy mane, he puts the yoke

<milestone unit="str" n="2"/>
And speech, and wind-swift thought, and all the

moods that mould a state, hath he taught himself; and

how to flee the arrows of the frost, when ’tis hard lodging

under the clear sky, and the arrows of the rushing rain ;

yea, he hath resource for all; without resource he meets

nothing that must come: only against Death shall he

call for aid in vain; but from baffling maladies he hath

I could have vowed that I should not soon be here

been lashed: but,—since the joy that surprises and
transcends our hopes is like in fulness to no other
pleasure—I have come, though ’tis in breach of my


<pb n="140"/>


sworn oath, bringing this maid; who was taken showing

grace to the dead. This time there was no casting of

lots; no, this luck hath fallen to me, and to none else.

And now, sire, take her thyself, question her, examine

her, as thou wilt; but I have a right to free and final
<milestone unit="line" n="400"/>
quittance of this trouble.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
And thy prisoner here—how and whence hast
thou taken her?

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Guard</speaker><p>
 She was burying the man; thou knowest all.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
Dost thou mean what thou sayest? Dost thou
speak aright?

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Guard</speaker><p>
 I saw her burying the corpse that thou hadst
forbidden to bury, Is that plain and clear?

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
And how was she seen? how taken in the act ?

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Guard</speaker><p>
 It befell on this wise. When we had come to
the place,—with those dread menaces of thine upon

<milestone unit="line" n="410"/>
us,—we swept away all the dust that covered the corpse,
and bared the dank body well; and then sat us down
on the brow of the hill, to windward, heedful that the
smell from him should not strike us; every man was
wide awake, and kept his neighbour alert with torrents
of threats, if any one should be careless of this task,

So went it, until the sun’s bright orb stood in mid
heaven, and the heat began to burn: and then suddenly
a whirlwind lifted from the earth a storm of dust, a
trouble in the sky, and filled the plain, marring all the

<milestone unit="line" n="420"/>
leafage of its woods; and the wide air was choked
therewith: we closed our eyes, and bore the plague
from the gods.

And when, after a long while, this storm had passed,
the maid was seen; and she cried aloud with the sharp


<pb n="141"/>


cry of a bird in its bitterness,—even as when, within
the empty nest, it sees the bed stripped of its nestlings.
So she also, when she saw the corpse bare, lifted up

a voice of wailing, and called down curses on the doers
of that deed. And straightway she brought thirsty
<milestone unit="line" n="430"/>
dust in her hands; and from a shapely ewer of bronze,
held high, with thrice-poured drink-offering she crowned
the dead.

We rushed forward when we saw it, and at once
closed upon our quarry, who was in no wise dismayed.
Then we taxed her with her past and present doings;
and she stood not on denial of aught,—at once to my
joy and to my pain. To have escaped from ills one’s
self is a great joy; but ‘tis painful to bring friends to
<milestone unit="line" n="440"/>
ill. Howbeit, all such things are of less account to me
than mine own safety.

<stage>Exit Guard.</stage>

<stage>To ANTIGONE.</stage>
Now, tell me thou—not in many
words, but briefly—knewest thou that an edict had forbidden
this ?

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker><p>
I knew it: could I help it? It was public.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
And thou didst indeed dare to transgress that
law?

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker><p>
<milestone unit="line" n="450"/>
Yes; for it was not Zeus that had published
me that edict; not such are the laws set among men
by the Justice who dwells with the gods below; nor
deemed I that thy decrees were of such force, that


<pb n="142"/>




a mortal could override the unwritten and unfailing
statutes of heaven. For their life is not of to-day or
yesterday, but from all time, and no man knows when
they were first put forth.

Not through dread of any human pride could I

<milestone unit="line" n="460"/>
answer to the gods for breaking these. Die I must,—

I knew that well (how should I not?)—even without
thy edicts. But if Iam to die before my time, I count
that a gain: for when any one lives, as I do, compassed
about with evils, can such an one find aught but gain
in death? OE A A EB om a DON

So for me to meet this doom is trifling grief; but
if I had suffered my mother’s son to lie in death an
unburied corpse, that would have grieved me; for this,
I am not grieved. And if my present deeds are foolish

<milestone unit="line" n="470"/>
in thy sight, it may be that a foolish judge arraigns my

folly.

there is no room for pride, when thou art thy neighbour’s

when she transgressed the laws that had been set forth;
and, that done, lo, a second insult,—to vaunt of this,
and exult in her deed.

Now verily I am no man, she is the man, if this

be she sister’s child, or nearer to me in blood ea any

her kinsfolk shall not avoid a doom most dire; for
<milestone unit="line" n="490"/>
indeed I charge that other with a like share in the
plotting of this burial.
And summon her—for I saw her e’en now within,—
raving, and not mistress of her wits. So oft, before the
deed, the mind stands self-convicted in its treason, when
folks are plotting mischief in the dark. But verily this,
too, is_hateful—when one who hath been caught in
wickedness then seeks to make the crime a glory.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker><p>
Wouldst thou do more than take and slay
me?

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
No more, indeed; having that, I have all.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker><p>
Why then dost thou delay? In thy discourse

there is nought that pleases me,—never may there be
and so my words must needs be unpleasing to thee.
And yet, for glory—whence could I have won a nobler,
than by giving burial to mine own brother? All here
would own that they thought it well, were not their lips
sealed by fear. But royalty, blest in so much besides,
hath the power to do and say what it will.

The dead man will not say that he so deems it.

Yea, if thou makest him but equal in honour

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker><p>
Blest are they whose days have not tasted of
evil. For when a house hath once been shaken from
heaven, there the curse fails nevermore, passing from
life to life of the race; even as, when the surge is driven
over the darkness of the deep by the fierce breath of
<milestone unit="line" n="590"/>
Thracian sea-winds, it rolls up the black sand from the
depths, and there is a sullen roar from wind-vexed headlands
that front the blows of the storm.</p>

<p>I see that from olden time the sorrows in the house
of the Labdacidae are heaped upon the sorrows of the
dead; and generation is not freed by generation, but
some god strikes them down, and the race hath no
deliverance.</p>

<p>For now that hope of which the light had been
<milestone unit="line" n="600"/>
spread above the last root of the house of Oedipus—
that hope, in turn, is brought low—by the blood-stained
dust due to the gods infernal, and by folly in speech,
and frenzy at the heart.

Thy power, O Zeus, what human trespass can limit?
That power which neither Sleep, the all-ensnaring, nor
the untiring months of the gods can master; but thou,

a ruler to whom time brings not old age, dwellest in the
<milestone unit="line" n="610"/>
dazzling splendour of Olympus.</p>
<p>And through the future, near and far, as through the




<pb n="148"/>


past, shall this law hold good: Nothing that is vast
enters into the life of mortals without a curse.

For that hope whose wanderings are so wide is to
many men a comfort, but to many a false lure of giddy

<milestone unit="line" n="620"/>
desires; and the disappointment comes on one who
knoweth nought till he burn his foot against the hot
fire.

For with wisdom hath some one given forth the
famous saying, that evil seems good, soon or late, to
him whose mind the god draws to mischief; and but
for the briefest space doth he fare free of woe.

But lo, Haemon, the last of thy sons;—comes he
grieving for the doom of his promised bride, Antigone,
<milestone unit="line" n="630"/>
and bitter for the baffled hope of his marriage?

<stage>Enter HAEMON.</stage>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
We shall know soon, better than seers could
tell us—My son, hearing the fixed doom of thy betrothed,
art thou come in rage against thy father? Or
have I thy good will, act how I may?

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Haemon</speaker><p>
Father, Iam thine; and thou, in thy wisdom,
tracest for me_rules which I shall follow. No marriage
shall be deemed by me a-greater gain than thy good
guidance.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
Yea, this, my son, should be thy heart’s fixed

<milestone unit="line" n="640"/>
law,—in_all things to obey thy father’s will, 'Tis for
this that men pray to see dutiful children grow up
around them in their homes,—that such may requite
their father’s foe with evil, and honour, as their father

 


<pb n="149"/>



doth, his friend. But he who begets unprofitable 
children—what shall we say that he hath sown, but —
troubles for himself, and much triumph for his foes?
Then do not thou, my son, at pleasure’s beck, dethrone
thy reason for a woman’s sake; knowing that this is
<milestone unit="line" n="650"/>
a joy that soon grows cold in clasping arms,—an evil
woman to share thy bed and thy home. For what
wound could strike deeper than a false friend? Nay,
with loathing, and as if she were thine enemy, let this
girl go to find a husband in the house of Hades. For
since I have taken her, alone of all the city, in open
disobedience, I will not make myself a liar to my
people—I will slay her.

So let her appeal as she will to the majesty of kindred
blood. If I am to nurture mine own kindred in
<milestone unit="line" n="660"/>
naughtiness, needs must I bear with it in aliens. He
who does his duty in his own household will be found 
righteous in the State also. But if any one transgresses, 
and does violence to the laws, or thinks to dictate to
his rulers, such an one can win no praise from me. No,
whomsoever the city may appoint, that man must be 
obeyed, in little things and great, in just things and 
unjust; and I should feel sure that one who thus obeys
would be a good ruler no less than a good subject, and
<milestone unit="line" n="670"/>
in the storm of spears would stand his ground where he
was set, loyal and dauntless at his comrade’s side.</p>

<p>But disobedience is the worst of evils. This it is
that ruins cities; this makes homes desolate; by this,
the ranks of allies are broken into headlong rout; but,
of the lives whose course is fair, the greater part owes
safety to obedience. Therefore we must support the


<pb n="150"/>




cause of order, and in no wise suffer a woman to worst

us. Better to fall from power, if must, by a man’s
<milestone unit="line" n="680"/>
hand; then we should not be called weaker than a

woman.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker><p>
To us, unless our years have stolen our wit,
thou seemest to say wisely what thou sayest.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Haemon</speaker><p>
Father, the gods implant reason in men, the
highest of all things that we call our own. Not mine
the skill—far from me be the quest!—to.say wherein
thou speakest not aright; and yet another man, too,
might have some useful thought. At least, it is my
natural office to watch, on thy behalf, all that men say,

<milestone unit="line" n="690"/>
or do, or find to blame. For the dread of thy frown



forbids the citizen to speak such words as would offend
thine ear; but I can hear these murmurs in the dark,
these moanings of the city for this maiden; ‘no woman,’
they say, ‘ever merited her doom less—none ever was
to die so shamelully Tor deedsclorious as hers; who, ds_so glorious as hers; who,
when her own brother had fallen in bloody strife, would
not leave him unburied, to be devoured by carrion dogs,
or by any bird:—deserves not she the meed of golden
honour ?”</p>

<milestone unit="line" n="700"/>

<p>Such is the darkling rumour that spreads in secret.
For me, my father, no treasure is so precious as thy
welfare. What, indeed, is a nobler ornament for children
than a prospering sire’s fair fame, or for sire than son’s?
Wear not, then, one mood only in thyself; think not
that thy word, and thine alone, must be right. For if
any man thinks that he alone is wise,—that in speech,
or in mind, he hath no peer,—such a soul, when Taid

 

open, is ever found empty.

And what, aged Teiresias, are thy tidings?


<pb n="160"/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Teiresias</speaker><p>
I will tell thee; and do thou hearken to the

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
Indeed, it has not been my wont to slight thy
counsel.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Teiresias</speaker><p>
Therefore didst thou steer our city’s course
aright.

I have felt, and can attest, thy benefits.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Teiresias</speaker><p>
Mark that now, once more, thou standest on

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
What means this? How I shudder at thy
message!

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Teiresias</speaker><p>
Thou wilt learn, when thou hearest the warnings
of mine art. As I took my place on mine old seat

<milestone unit="line" n="1000"/> 
of augury, where all birds have been. wont to gather

within my ken, I heard a strange voice among them; they
were screaming with dire, feverish rage, that drowned
their language in a jargon; and I knew that they were
rending each other with their talons, murderously ; the
whirr of wings told no doubtful tale.</p>

<p>Forthwith, in fear, I essayed burnt-sacrifice on a duly
kindled altar: but from my offerings the Fire-god
showed no flame; a dank moisture, oozing from the
thigh-flesh, trickled forth upon the embers, and smoked,


<milestone unit="line" n="1010"/> 
and sputtered; the gall was scattered to the air; and

the streaming thighs lay bared of the fat that had been
wrapped round them.

Such was the failure of the rites by which I vainly
asked a sign, as from this boy I learned; for he is my
guide, as I am guide to others. And ’tis thy counsel
that hath brought this sickness on our State. For the

altars of our city and of our hearths have been tainted,


<pb n="161"/>

hapless corpse, the son of Oedipus: and therefore the
<milestone unit="line" n="1020"/> 
gods no more accept prayer and sacrifice at our hands,

or the flame of meat-offering ; nor doth any bird give
a clear sign by its shrill cry, for they have tasted the
fatness of a slain man’s blood.

Think, then, on these things, my son. All men are
liable to err ; but when an error hath been made, that
man is no longer witless or unblest who heals the ill
into which he hath fallen, and remains not stubborn.

Self-will, we know, incurs the charge of folly. Nay,

allow the claim of the dead; stab not the fallen; what
<milestone unit="line" n="1030"/> 
prowess is it to slay the slain anew? I have sought


thy good, and for thy good I speak: and never is it
sweeter to learn from a good counsellor than when he
counsels for thine own gain.

Then know thou—aye, know it well—that thou

shalt not live through many more courses of the sun’s
swift chariot, ere one begotten of thine own loins shall

have been given by thee, a corpse for corpses; because
thou hast thrust children of the sunlight to the shades,

and ruthlessly lodged a living soul in the grave; but
 

keepest in this world one who belongs to the gods
infernal, a corpse unburied, unhonoured, all unhallowed.
In such thou hast no part, nor have the gods above, but


<pb n="163"/>


this is a violence done to them by thee. Therefore the 
avenging destroyers lie in wait for thee, the Furies of
Hades and of the gods, that thou mayest be taken in
these same ills.</p>

<p>And mark well if I speak these things as a hireling.

A time not long to be delayed shall awaken the wailing

of men and of women in thy house. And a tumult of
<milestone unit="line" n="1080"/>
hatred against thee stirs all the cities whose mangled
sons had the burial-rite from dogs, or from wild beasts,

or from some winged bird that bore a polluting breath

to each city that contains the hearths of the dead.</p>

<p>Such arrows for thy heart—since thou provokest me
—have I launched at thee, archer-like, in my anger,—
sure arrows, of which thou shalt not escape the smart.—
Boy, lead me home, that he may spend his rage on
younger men, and learn to keep a tongue more temperate,

and to bear within his breast a better mind than
now he bears.

<milestone unit="line" n="1230"/>
mischance hath marred thy reason? Come forth, my
child! I pray thee—I implore!’ But the boy glared
at him with fierce eyes, spat in his face, and, without
a word of answer, drew his cross-hilted sword :—as his
father rushed forth in flight, he missed his aim ;—then,
hapless one, wroth with himself, he straightway leaned
with all his weight against his sword, and drove it, half
its length, into his side; and, while sense lingered, he
clasped the maiden to his faint embrace, and, as he
gasped, sent forth on her pale cheek the swift stream
of the oozing blood.</p>

<p>Corpse enfolding corpse he lies; he hath won his
nuptial rites, poor youth, not here, yet in the halls of
Death ; and he hath witnessed to mankind that, of all
curses which cleave to man, ill counsel is the sovereign
curse.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker><p>
What wouldst thou augur from this? The
lady hath turned back, and is gone, without a word,
good or evil.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker><p>
I, too, am startled; yet I nourish the hope
that, at these sore tidings of her son, she cannot deign
to give her sorrow public vent, but in the privacy of the
house will set her handmaids to mourn the household

<milestone unit="line" n="1250"/>
grief. For she is not untaught of discretion, that she
should err.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker><p>
I know not; but to me, at least, a strained
silence seems to portend peril, no less than vain abundance
of lament.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker><p>
Well, I will enter the house, and learn whether


<pb n="169"/>


indeed she is not hiding some repressed purpose in the

depths of a passionate heart. Yea, thou sayest well:

excess of silence, too, may have a perilous meaning.
<stage>Exit MESSENGER.</stage>

<stage>Enter CREON, on the spectators’ left, with attendants, carrying the shrouded body of HAEMON on a bier.</stage>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker><p>
Lo, yonder the king himself draws near, bearing
that which tells too clear a tale,—the work of no
<milestone unit="line" n="1260"/>
stranger’s madness,—if we may say it,—-but of his own
misdecds.

<milestone unit="str" n="1"/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
Woe for the sins of a darkened soul, stubborn 
sins, fraught with death! Ah, ye behold us, the sire
who hath slain, the son who hath perished! Woe is
me, for the wretched blindness of my counsels! Alas,
my son, thou hast died in thy youth, by a timeless
doom, woe_is_me!—thy spirit hath fled,—not by thy
folly, but by mine own!

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker><p>
<milestone unit="str" n="2"/>
Ah me, how all too late thou seemest to see 
<milestone unit="line" n="1270"/>
the right !

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
Ah me, I have learned the bitter lesson! But
then, methinks, oh then, some god smote me from above
with crushing weight, and hurled me into ways of
cruelty, woe is me,—overthrowing and trampling on my
joy! Woe, woe, for the troublous toils of men!

<stage>Enter MESSENGER from the house.</stage>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker><p>
Sire, thou hast come, methinks, as one whose


<pb n="170"/>


hands are not empty, but who hath store laid up besides;
thou bearest yonder burden with thee; and thou
<milestone unit="line" n="1280"/>
art soon to look upon the woes within thy house.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
And what worse ill is yet to follow upon ills?

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker><p>
Thy queen hath died, true mother of yon
corpse—ah, hapless lady !—by blows newly dealt.

<milestone unit="ant" n="1"/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
Oh Hades, all-receiving, whom no sacrifice can

appease! Hast thou, then, no mercy for me? O thou

herald of evil, bitter tidings, what word dost thou utter?

Alas, I was already as dead, and thou hast smitten me

anew! What sayest thou, my son? What is this new

<milestone unit="line" n="1290"/>
message that thou bringest—woe, woe is me !—of a wife’s
doom, —of slaughter heaped on slaughter?

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker><p>
Thou canst behold: ’tis no longer hidden within.
<stage>The doors of the palace are opened, and the corpse of EURYDICE is disclosed.</stage>

<milestone unit="ant" n="2"/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
Ah me,—yonder I behold a new, a second woe!

What destiny, ah what, can yet await me? I have but

now raised my son in my arms,—and there, again, I see

<milestone unit="line" n="1300"/>
a corpse before me! Alas, alas, unhappy mother! Alas,
my child!

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker><p>
There, at the altar, self-stabbed with a keen
knife, she suffered her darkening eyes to close, when
she had wailed for the noble fate of Megareus who died
before, and then for his fate who lies there,—and when,
with her last breath, she had invoked evil fortunes upon
thee, the slayer of thy sons,

<milestone unit="str" n="3"/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
Woe, woe! I thrill with dread. Is there none 
to strike me to the heart with two-edged sword ?—O
<milestone unit="line" n="1310"/>
miserable that I am, and steeped in miserable anguish!

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker><p>
Yea, both this son’s doom, and that other’s,
were laid to thy charge by her whose corpse thou
seest.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
And what was the manner of the violent deed
by which she passed away?

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker><p>
Her own hand struck her to the heart, when
she had learned her son’s sorely lamented fate.

<milestone unit="str" n="4"/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
Ah me, this guilt can never be fixed on any 
other of mortal kind, for my acquittal! I, even I, was
<milestone unit="line" n="1320"/>
thy slayer, wretched that I am—I own the truth. Lead
me away, O my servants, lead me hence with all speed,
whose life is but as death!

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker><p>
Thy counsels are good, if there can be good
with ills; briefest is best, when trouble is in our path.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
Oh, let it come, let it appear, that fairest of anv. 3.

fates for me, that brings my last day,—aye, best fate
of all! Oh, let it come, that I may never look upon
to-morrow’s light.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker><p>
These things are in the future; present tasks
claim our care: the ordering of the future rests where
it should rest.

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
All my desires, at least, were summed in that
prayer.


<pb n="172"/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker><p>
Pray thou no more; for mortals have no escape
from destined woe,

<milestone unit="ant" n="4"/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Creon</speaker><p>
Lead me away, I pray you; a rash, foolish

<milestone unit="line" n="1340"/>
man; who have slain thee, ah my son, unwittingly, and

thee, too, my wife—unhappy that I am! I know not

which way I should bend my gaze, or where I should

seek support ; for all is amiss with that which is in my

hands,—and yonder, again, a crushing fate hath leapt
upon my head.

<stage>As CREON is being conducted into the house, the Coryphaeus speaks the closing verses.</stage>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker><p>
Wisdom is the supreme part of happiness; and
reverence towards the gods must be inviolate. Great

words of prideful men are ever punished with great
blows, and, in old age, teach the chastened to be wise.
